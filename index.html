            The dataset we selected for our analysis encompasses the stock price of Apple Inc. over the past several years. Given the extensive volume of data, which includes daily stock prices from the 1990s to the present, we narrowed our focus to the period from 2022 to the current date. This timeframe is interesting as it allows us to examine the impact of Apple's breakthrough product, the 'Vision Pro', on the stock price surrounding its release in June 2023.

            While considering various methods to visualize this data, we ruled out line graphs and bar charts. Line graphs, although straightforward, fail to provide detailed price range information within each period. Similarly, bar charts fall short in effectively conveying the progression of opening and closing stock values. Finally, we chose candlestick chart enhanced with interactive tooltips.

            Our visual encodings utilize the finance industry's standard color conventions: green signifies upward trends, while red indicates declines. This color coding is designed to be recognizable to individuals accustomed to stock market charts, thus aiding in quick and efficient comprehension.
            To further our chart's utility, we embedded tooltips that reveal exact data points as the cursor moves over individual elements. This feature maintains a streamlined chart appearance while simultaneously offering in-depth data upon request, striking a balance between visual clarity and comprehensive information.

            We also incorporating trading volume data at the bottom, presented in a histogram format with interactive capabilities that highlight specific daily volumes. The histogram's subdued gray color and placement beneath the main chart keep the focus on the candlestick patterns while still providing context regarding market activity. Volume can help us confirm the strength or weakness of a price trend. For instance, an upward trend accompanied by increasing volume is generally seen as stronger and more likely to continue than a trend with decreasing volume.
